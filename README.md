#Aloha Project
This is a project to showcase HTML and CSS to build a responsive website as part of the Web Development Program at RED Academy. 

## Skills Learned
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Responsive Web Design



What I should've focused is on the core componets of the website instead of small details. 

In the future I should manage my time better and focus while doing the website than getting sidetracked. 

If I get a chance in the future to redo this I will.

- Things to work on

Adding more divs
labeling divs more specificly
learning the langauge more.
